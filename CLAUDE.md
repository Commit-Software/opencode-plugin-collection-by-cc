# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A collection of [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugins installable via npm as `opencode-plugins-cc`. Currently provides the `/simplify` slash command; more commands will be added over time.

## Build & Publish Commands

```bash
bun install                 # Install dev dependencies
bun run build               # Compile index.ts → dist/ (JS bundle + .d.ts types)
npm publish                 # Builds first via prepublishOnly, then publishes to npm
```

## How the Plugin Works

OpenCode loads npm plugins at startup by calling the plugin's default export (a `Plugin` function). This plugin:
1. Receives a context object `{ $, ... }` where `$` is Bun's shell API
2. Writes `~/.config/opencode/skills/simplify/SKILL.md` to register the `/simplify` slash command
3. Returns `{}` (no event hooks needed)

**Why skills?** OpenCode discovers slash commands from SKILL.md files in `~/.config/opencode/skills/<name>/`. Writing the file at plugin load time is the mechanism to register a user-invocable `/command`.

## Key Files

- `index.ts` — Plugin entry point; contains `SKILL_CONTENT` (the simplifier prompt) and writes it to the skills directory
- `package.json` — npm package config; name is `opencode-plugins-cc`
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript config with `bundler` module resolution (required by bun build)
- `dist/` — Built output (not committed); generated by `bun run build`

## Plugin Type System

The `@opencode-ai/plugin` peer dependency provides:
- `Plugin` type — `async (ctx: PluginInput) => Hooks`
- `tool()` — registers AI-callable tools (not used here)
- Available hooks: `auth`, `event`, `chat.params`, `chat.message`, `shell.env`, etc.

## Adding More Commands to This Collection

Each new command is a new skill. In `index.ts`:
1. Define a `SKILL_CONTENT` string with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) and the prompt body
2. Add a `Bun.write(join(skillDir, "SKILL.md"), SKILL_CONTENT)` call in the plugin function
3. The skill name in the frontmatter becomes the `/command-name` in OpenCode
4. Add the command to the **Available Commands** section of `README.md`
